The project was done to understand and get a feeling of :
K-means Clustering
Prediction using clustering

To make the project basic, fake data was generated so as to ensure that the data fed to the K-Means clustering algorithm had 5 clusters in it. 
It is assumed that the number of clusters in the data are 5. This is not done in Unsupervised Learning, where one has to decide on the number of clusters and vary it to find the best fit.

Division of 100 random people (fake data) is done into 5 clusters based on age and income. Normalisation is done so as to ensure that the range (age - [20, 70] and income - [20k, 200k]) is made comparable for the data to be compared along and meaningful clusters to be made.

The results of the algorithm can be found in the results.txt file and the scatter plot is attached separately.
