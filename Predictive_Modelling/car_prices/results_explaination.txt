The project was done in order to learn and get familiar with the concepts of:
MultiVariate regression
Normalisation of data
Pandas - dataframes
OLS - Ordinary Least Squares Regression


Explanation of the results

The table of coefficients above gives us the values to plug into an equation of form:
    B0 + B1 * Mileage + B2 * model_ord + B3 * doors

As can be seen from the results.txt file, the values of the coefficients of the three variables that we took for analysis has come. In that, one can clearly see that Cylinder impacts the car_prices the most. 

It is assumed that there is not correlation amongst the different variables themselves in order for the Multivariate Regression to work.
