The project was done in order to learn the following concepts:
Supervised Learning
Naive Bayes Classifier
Working of CountVectorizer( ) of scikit-learn

First, the cleaning of data is done so that only the text of the emails are obtained and stored in the dataframe object along with their classes - spam/ham. 

Then the data was trained on the given dataset of spam/ham emails. The dataset is small. Hence, the classifier is not that good. However, it still predicts to a certain degree, as being shown by three sample testing texts, the results of which are in the results.txt file.
